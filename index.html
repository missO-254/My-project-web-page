    <h2>Why Wholeness Hub?</h2>
    <p>
      Many of us carry <strong>unseen psychological wounds</strong> from our childhood.  
      Trauma can come from our guardians, the environment we grew up in, or painful life events.  
      These experiences shape our beliefs, sometimes holding us back from reaching our full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is born from my own journey — learning how trauma and environment affect who we become, and discovering ways to heal and step into purpose.

  <!-- Personal Story -->
  <section class="my-journey">
    <h2>💙 My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      As a young girl, I always dreamed of a happy, successful, and fulfilling life. 
      My childhood was joyful, but when I lost my dad at the age of 4, his absence quietly shaped my path in ways I didn’t realize until adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I later discovered that I was unconsciously searching for my father’s love, validation, and approval in the men I dated. 
      This left me drained, lost, and feeling like I wasn’t enough. Psychological wounds are invisible — unlike physical ones — but they deeply affect how we think, relate, and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through inner work and reflection, I began to heal. With each passing day, I’m becoming better and more whole. 
      I share this part of my story to remind you that no matter what you’ve been through, you can rise, heal, and step into the life you deserve.
